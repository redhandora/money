Scenario: Matrix completeness and stage coverage
file_check=PASS
--- stage rows ---
| Ingestion | AWS Elemental MediaConvert + S3 events; Cloudflare Stream ingest; Mux Direct Upload | FFmpeg + yt-dlp + object storage (MinIO/S3-compatible); custom webhook intake API | Choose managed when source diversity is high and ops team <2 FTE. Choose self-hosted when rights metadata rules are custom and source endpoints change frequently. | Keep normalized mezzanine format (H.264 + AAC + sidecar JSON). Preserve source IDs in neutral schema so pipelines can be replayed in a different platform. |
| ASR | AWS Transcribe; Azure Speech to Text | Whisper large-v3 (batch); NVIDIA NeMo ASR (GPU) | Choose managed for bursty demand, many locales, and no GPU SRE. Choose self-hosted when monthly ASR minutes are predictable and data residency requires private VPC/on-prem processing. | Store word-level timestamps in open JSON schema. Keep at least one cloud ASR and one self-hosted profile ready behind a feature flag. |
| Translation | AWS Translate; Azure Translator | Marian NMT/OPUS-MT; NLLB-200 (fine-tuned) | Choose managed for long-tail language coverage and rapid rollout. Choose self-hosted when domain terminology drift is high and glossary retraining cadence is weekly. | Keep translation memory (TMX/CSV) and glossary files vendor-neutral. Route by language pair so one provider outage does not stop all locales. |
| TTS | AWS Polly; Azure Speech TTS | Coqui TTS; Piper/XTTS-v2 | Choose managed when voice quality target is premium with low engineering overhead. Choose self-hosted when voice cloning policy allows and steady character volume justifies dedicated inference. | Separate script text from voice profile IDs. Keep two voice packs per locale (primary + fallback) with loudness normalization at post-process step. |
| Compositing | AWS MediaConvert captions burn-in; Azure Media Services workflow components | FFmpeg filtergraph pipeline; GStreamer batch renderer | Choose managed when delivery formats are mostly standard and turnaround SLA is strict. Choose self-hosted when subtitle styling, karaoke timing, or per-channel branding rules are custom. | Render from intermediate assets (video master + audio stems + subtitle tracks). If managed rendering fails, rerun from same intermediates in FFmpeg. |
| Orchestration | Temporal Cloud; Prefect Cloud | Temporal OSS; Airflow OSS | Choose managed when workflow durability and audit logs are required immediately with minimal platform ops. Choose self-hosted when compliance requires full control plane ownership or cloud spend caps are strict. | Define workflows in code with provider adapters. Keep activity interfaces stable (`ingest`, `asr`, `translate`, `tts`, `render`, `publish`) so backend can be swapped. |
| Distribution | YouTube Data API + Content Manager flow; TikTok API/composer integrations (where available) | Direct platform upload workers using official APIs; CMS scheduler + webhook publisher | Choose managed connectors when supported platform set is small and API quotas are stable. Choose self-hosted distribution when per-platform policy checks and retries need custom control. | Treat publish eligibility and monetize eligibility as separate gates. Queue per-platform publish jobs so one platform outage does not block all destinations. |
