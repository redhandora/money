## Publish vs Monetize

- YouTube: upload/presence and policy compliance are platform rules; monetization adds YPP-specific gates (originality, rights, advertiser suitability).
- TikTok: community-compliant content can still fail monetization eligibility under Creator Rewards terms and rewards policy constraints.
- Meta: content can be allowed on platform under Community Standards but still ineligible for monetization under Partner/Content Monetization Policies.
