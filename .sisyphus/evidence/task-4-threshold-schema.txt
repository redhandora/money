- `auto-pass`: `rights_confidence`, `term_adherence`, and `av_sync_ms` are all `auto-pass`.

- `auto-pass`: `publish_eligibility=auto-pass`, `monetization_eligibility=auto-pass`, and `rollback_mttr=auto-pass`.
- `HITL-review`: no hard-stop exists and at least one of `publish_eligibility`, `monetization_eligibility`, or `rollback_mttr` is `HITL-review`.

- If `rights_confidence` is <0.960 for any release batch, set `publish_eligibility=hard-stop`, execute `pause_distribution` for the affected batch, and execute `rollback` for any active canary release built from the failing profile.
- If `term_adherence` is <0.940 or `av_sync_ms` is >220 ms in canary, set `publish_eligibility=hard-stop`, execute `pause_distribution`, and execute `rollback` before any additional distribution.
- If `rollback_mttr` exceeds 60 minutes on the most recent hard-stop incident, set rollout gate to `hard-stop` and block phase expansion until two consecutive incident drills restore `rollback_mttr` to <=30 minutes.
If strike_rate rises to the hard-stop band, do not resume monetization or rollout until strike_rate returns to <0.20% for 14 consecutive days and HITL sign-off is logged.

- A lane can be `publish_eligibility=auto-pass` and `monetization_eligibility=HITL-review` at the same time; monetization remains disabled until review is cleared.
- Any `hard-stop` in publish controls blocks both publish and monetization for the affected lane.
